# Car Plate Detection

[Live Demo](https://car-plate-detection.streamlit.app/)

## Overview
A real-time car plate detection system built using **YOLOv8**, **OpenCV**, **Python**, and **Streamlit**. The project detects and tracks license plates in real-time from video streams, providing an interactive web application for users.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 and OpenCV to identify car plates with high accuracy.
- **Web Application**: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly and interactive interface.
- **Robust Performance**: Optimized for various environmental conditions and real-time processing.
- **Efficient**: Designed to process video streams with high speed and minimal latency.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **YOLOv8**
- **Streamlit**

## Highlights
- Developed a real-time car plate detection system using YOLOv8, OpenCV, Python, and Streamlit to build an interactive web application for license plate identification and tracking.
- Implemented advanced object detection techniques ensuring high accuracy in various lighting and environmental conditions.
- Optimized the model for speed and efficiency to handle video streams and real-time processing.
- Designed a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit, enhancing usability and system performance.
